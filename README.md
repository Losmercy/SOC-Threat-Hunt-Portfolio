# SOC-Community-Threat-Hunt-Portfolio

A personal collection of threat hunts, detections, and MITRE ATT&CK–mapped investigations, built while being an active member of the MyDFIR SOC Community.

This repo doubles as a portfolio to showcase your growth as a SOC analyst — demonstrating how you hunt, investigate, and document findings.

📂 Repository Structure

/hunts/ → Writeups of completed hunts/mini-challenges

/investigations/ → Case reports, modified after community feedback, with screenshots and supporting evidence

/kql/ → Reusable KQL queries and detection logic

🧩 Hunt Template

Each hunt writeup should follow this format:

- **Technique**: MITRE ATT&CK ID & name

- **Summary**: What the technique is and how attackers use it

- **Detection Strategy**: Relevant log sources and suspicious indicators

- **KQL**: Queries used in the hunt

- **Triage & Investigation**: What to check first, and when to escalate

- **Mitigation & Remediation**: How to prevent and respond

🧾 Investigations

All investigation reports should:

- Incorporate feedback received from the MyDFIR SOC Community

- Be posted in /investigations/ as a completed case report

- Include supporting evidence such as screenshots, queries, and findings

This section highlights your ability to take feedback, improve, and document investigations — a key SOC skill.

📑 KQL Template

Each KQL entry should include:

- **Objective**: What the query is designed to find

- **Suspicious Indicators**: What analysts should look for in the results

- **KQL Query**: The detection logic itself

🎯 Purpose

This playbook is designed to demonstrate:

🔍 Threat hunting skills

💻 KQL development

📝 SOC triage & investigations

🗂️ MITRE ATT&CK mapping

Over time, this becomes a portfolio you can showcase in interviews, proving your ability to think, hunt, and communicate like a SOC analyst.
