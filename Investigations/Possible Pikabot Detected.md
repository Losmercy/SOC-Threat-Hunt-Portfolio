1) Check for evidence of execution of Pikachu.exe on the host: 192.168.10.34, if the application had been executed, Immediately isolate this host and consider a forensic investigation to determine the impact of this incident. Otherwise perform a complete wipe of this machine to ensure complete removal of additional artifacts that may be left behind. 

2) Run a query searching for the domains, IPs & file hash of the file downloaded to identify other hosts exhibiting similar behaviors. If additional hosts were found, immediately isolate them as well. 

3) Although domains are relatively easy to change for an attacker, consider placing these domains in a blocklist to prevent additional compromise.
